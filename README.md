- **Home Scrren**

   This Home Scrren allows users to view library statistics such as the total number of books, classifications, patrons, and librarians. It also shows information about new borrows, returns, and overdue books. Users can also see borrowing transactions, a list of patrons with borrowed books and their due dates, and unpaid transactions. The program allows librarians to change their passwords and view the most reserved book.
